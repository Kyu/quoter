# Quoter

- Add your quotes to the quote.json file and type :quotename: (then a space) to enter the quote
- Typing `@@help` in any text box shows a help message box
- `@@offquote` turns off the quoting and `@@onquote` reloads the program/turns quoting back on
- You can also set '@@clipboard@@' to true in the quotes.json file to enable copying the quote to clipboard, as opposed to typing it out
- Ctrl + Alt + Q stops the program entirely
